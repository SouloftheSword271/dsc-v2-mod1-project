## Repository contents

This repository contains the following:

* Jupyter Notebook containing technical analysis of the dataset

* pdf of slides for non-technical presentation

* csv containing the dataset used in the project

## Current state of model

Train Mean Squared Error: price    1.560026e+10

Test Mean Squared Error: price    1.767654e+10

Average predicted price: $542532.02

Average actual price: $547388.82

## To do 

Create new model with:

- [ ] scaled data

- [ ] include more categories in model

- [ ] remove dummy variables with p-value > 0.05

- [ ] add features that take distance from Microsoft and Boeing into account

- [ ] attempt to find if there's a particular region or zipcode that is impacted by proximity to these companies
